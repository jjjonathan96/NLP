# NLP

Here are some interesting NLP (Natural Language Processing) project ideas that range from beginner to advanced levels:

### **Beginner-Level Projects:**
1. **Text Classification (Sentiment Analysis)**
   - Build a model to classify movie reviews, tweets, or customer feedback as positive, neutral, or negative.
   - Dataset: IMDb Movie Reviews, Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset, Yelp Reviews.

2. **Spam Detection**
   - Create a spam filter that classifies emails or messages as spam or not spam.
   - Dataset: SMS Spam Collection, Enron Email Dataset.

3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
   - Develop an NER model that can identify entities such as names of people, organizations, or locations from text.
   - Dataset: CoNLL-2003, SpaCy's built-in datasets.

4. **Language Translation**
   - Build a simple English-to-French (or other language) translation model using Seq2Seq (sequence-to-sequence) models.
   - Dataset: WMT Dataset, Europarl Parallel Corpus.

5. **Text Summarization**
   - Implement a text summarizer that extracts or generates concise summaries of long articles or documents.
   - Dataset: CNN/Daily Mail News dataset, Reddit TIFU dataset.

### **Intermediate-Level Projects:**
1. **Question Answering System**
   - Build a system that answers questions based on a given passage or context (similar to a chatbot).
   - Dataset: SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset).

2. **Topic Modeling**
   - Use topic modeling algorithms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover hidden topics within a large set of documents (e.g., news articles, blog posts).
   - Dataset: 20 Newsgroups, Reuters-21578.

3. **Fake News Detection**
   - Develop a classifier to identify whether a given news article is real or fake.
   - Dataset: Fake News Dataset, LIAR Dataset.

4. **Chatbot using GPT/Transformer Models**
   - Build a chatbot using GPT-2, GPT-3, or BERT. The bot should be able to generate natural responses to input text.
   - Dataset: Custom datasets, OpenAI API (for GPT-3).

5. **Plagiarism Detection**
   - Create a tool to detect whether a piece of text has been plagiarized from another source, by comparing it with a reference dataset.
   - Dataset: PAN Plagiarism Detection Dataset.

### **Advanced-Level Projects:**
1. **Text Generation with GPT/Transformer**
   - Create a text generation model to write stories, essays, or creative content using GPT or other Transformer models.
   - Dataset: Gutenberg Project (for literature), OpenAI GPT-2/3 datasets.

2. **Speech-to-Text Conversion**
   - Build a speech recognition system that converts spoken language into written text using deep learning models like DeepSpeech.
   - Dataset: LibriSpeech, Common Voice Dataset.

3. **Document Search Engine (Semantic Search)**
   - Build a search engine that retrieves documents based on the meaning of the query rather than keyword matching using models like BERT for semantic similarity.
   - Dataset: Wikipedia dump, Stack Overflow questions, or a custom document corpus.

4. **Text Style Transfer**
   - Create a system that can change the style of text while retaining its original meaning, e.g., converting informal text to formal text or changing between different literary styles.
   - Dataset: Yelp Reviews (for sentiment style transfer), Shakespeare translations.

5. **Automatic Essay Grading**
   - Build a system to automatically grade essays based on content quality, grammar, and relevance to the topic.
   - Dataset: ASAP Automated Essay Scoring dataset.

6. **Multimodal Sentiment Analysis**
   - Build a sentiment analysis model that combines text with other modalities, such as speech or images, to understand sentiment (useful for videos or social media posts).
   - Dataset: MOSI (Multimodal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity dataset).

Each of these projects would allow you to explore various NLP techniques, including word embeddings, RNNs/LSTMs, Transformer models, and transfer learning. You can also experiment with popular libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face's Transformers, and SpaCy.
